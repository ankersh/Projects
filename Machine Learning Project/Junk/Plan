THEANO NOT TENSORFLOW!!

Monday TODO:
  Basic CNN
  Improved CNN
  Get MLP to output a properly formatted CSV
  Same for CNN



TODO:

  Get MLP to produce some sort of reasonable prediction, formatted correctly
  Get CNN to produce correctly formatted prediction

  Change copied code:
    Getting images from folders
    labels
    convertedarray
    log_loss

  For HOG:
    Mess about with cell size, with reasoning
    Mess about with block size, with reasoning

    Get Hog.py to output useful predictions we can check against on a split training data.
    We need:
      Vanilla HOG                                         :
      HOG with modified cell size 1                       :
      HOG with modified cell size 2                       :
      HOG with modified block size & cell size 1          :
      HOG with modified block size & cell size 2          :
      HOG with modified block size & cell size 3          :
      HOG with best modified cell size & block size.      :


      rawimage = rawimage.flatten()
